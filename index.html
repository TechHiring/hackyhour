          <h2>Where: New Leaf Initiative</h2>

          <h3>Why Hacky Hour?</h3>

          <p>Over the past couple years of running meetups and working with developers, we realized that there are
          probably <strong>close to 1,000</strong> software developers in the Happy Valley region, and they almost
          never get together to hang out and hack. We wanted to provide a time and a space for that to happen.</p>

          <h3>Is there any charge?</h3>

          <p>Nope. It's free for all attendees.</p>

          <h3>How do I get there?</h3>

          <p>Hacky Hour is held at the beautiful <a href="http://newleafinitiative.org">New Leaf Initiative</a>
            co-working space. It's on the 3rd floor of the State College Borough Building.</p>

          <h3>What is the format?</h3>

          <p>It's an informal meetup. New Leaf has couches, tables, conference rooms. People can use the time to
            hang out with people that they know, meet new people, work with a pair on a project, or just sit on a couch
            and code solo.
          </p>

          <h3>Will there be any talks?</h3>

          <p>Our kickoff event on 9/24/15 will feature a series of lightning talks by local hackers who will tell us about their projects. And once in a while we'll
          bring in a national speaker to talk to the entire audience. But organized talks will not be the normal focus
          of the event &mdash; we prefer to keep it centered around small conversations and random meetings instead.</p>

          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

          <p>Bring your laptop, so you can work on your project or show other people what you're working on.</p>

          <h3>I was led to believe that there would be punch and pie.</h3>

          <p>We will have some good snacks and drinks. It won't be a full dinner, but it will be enough to keep
          everyone in a good mood. Feel free to bring your own food and drinks.</p>

          <p><strong>No alcoholic beverages, please</strong> &mdash; we want to be welcoming to those who are under age
           or do not drink, and it's against New Leaf's lease. When the festivities are over at 8pm, we imagine that
          there will be informal groups heading out to any one of the other fine establishments downtown.</p>
