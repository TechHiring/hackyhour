# Hacky Hour

Public website for hackyhour.com, created with GitHub Pages

## Development

Since it's a static site that's hosted with github pages, you just push to github to deploy. Github
follows the convention that the site will be in a `gh-pages` branch, which in this case is the 
only branch in the repo (there is no master).
